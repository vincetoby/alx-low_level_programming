2. **1-compiler**: This script compiles a C file but does not link (The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE, The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c .
3. **2-assembler**: This script generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file (The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE, The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c. ) 
4. **3-name**: This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun (The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE)
5. **4-puts.c**: This C-program prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
