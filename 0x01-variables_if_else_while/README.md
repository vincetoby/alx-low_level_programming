This README explains each script and C-program
1. 0-positive_or_negative.c: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
2. 1-last_digit.c: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
The output of the program should be:

    The string "Last digit of", followed by
    "n", followed by
    the string is, followed by:
        if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
        if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
        if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
    followed by a new line
3. 2-print_alphabet.c:  a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. 3-print_alphabet.c: a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5. 4-print_alphabt.c: a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.	
        * Print all the letters except q and e
   	* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
  	* All your code should be in the main function
   	* You can only use putchar twice in your code
6. 5-print_numbers.c:  a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. 6-print_numberz.c: Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
8. 7-print_tebahpla.c: a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
9. 8-print_base16.c: a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
10. 9-print_comb.c: a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
    * Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    * Numbers should be printed in ascending order
11. 100-print_comb3.c: a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
    * Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    * The two digits must be different
    * 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
    * Print only the smallest combination of two digits
    * Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
12. 101-print_comb4.c: a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits
    * Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    * The three digits must be different
    * 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
    * Print only the smallest combination of three digits
    * Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
13. 102-print_comb5.c:  a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
    * The numbers should range from 0 to 99
    * The two numbers should be separated by a space
    * All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
    * The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
    * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
    * 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
