* 0-strcat.c:  a function that concatenates two strings.
* 1-strncat.c:  a function that concatenates two strings.

   * Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
    * The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
        it will use at most n bytes from src; and
        src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
    * Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
* 2-strncpy.c:  a function that copies a string exactly like strncpy.
* 3-strcmp.c: a function that compares two strings.
* 4-rev_array.c:  a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
* 5-string_toupper.c: a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
* 6-cap_string.c: a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
* 7-leet.c: a function that encodes a string into 1337.
* 100-rot13.c: a function that encodes a string using rot13.
* 101-print_number.c: a function that prints an integer.
