* 0-memset.c: fills memory with a constant byte just like the memset; it fills the first **n** bytes of the memory area pointed to by **s** with the constant byte **b** and eturns a pointer to the memory area **s**
*
* 2-strchr.c: a function that locates a character in a string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found.
* 3-strspn.c: a function that gets the length of a prefix substring and returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
* 4-strpbrk.c: This  function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found

* 5-strstr.c: This function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
it returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
