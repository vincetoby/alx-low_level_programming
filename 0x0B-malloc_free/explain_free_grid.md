# Explanation of code

This code defines a function named free_grid that is used to deallocate memory from a dynamically allocated 2D array.

## This the implementation of the free_grid function:
<pre><code>void free_grid(int **grid, int height)
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < height; i++)
        free(grid[i]);
    free(grid);
}
                    </pre></code>

1. The function starts by iterating through each row of the 2D array using a loop that runs from 0 to height - 1. Inside the loop:

2. It calls the free function on each row (grid[i]) of the 2D array to deallocate the memory associated with that row. This step is essential to avoid memory leaks.

3. After deallocating all the rows, the function then calls free once more on the grid pointer itself. This deallocates the memory block that was used to store the array of row pointers (grid).

The end result is that the entire memory used for the 2D array, including both the data and the pointers, is properly deallocated. This function helps prevent memory leaks when working with dynamically allocated 2D arrays.

Remember that using this function requires that the 2D array was dynamically allocated using appropriate memory allocation functions (malloc, calloc, etc.) before calling free_grid.
